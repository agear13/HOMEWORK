The name of the company is Dapper Lab.

Found at Dapperlab.com, the company was founded in February of 2018. 

# Who are the founders of the company?

There are three founders of Dapper Lab. They are Dieter Shirley, Mack Flavelle, Roham Gharegozlou. 

# How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

The founders all had a mission in mind when creating Dapper Labs. They wanted to bring Blockchain and its many benefits as a technology to the mass market. They thought the best way to do this was to create games with Blockchain technologies so that people become accustometed to utilising Blockchain innovations such as cryptocurrency and Smart Contracts. 

# How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

Dapper Labs created their first game called Cryptokittens which gained popularity quickly. Their platform took a commission of each crypto exchange that players made playing Cryptokittens. Thus, Dapper made money from these initial transactions, however to expand further, raised seed money from investors. 

To date, they have gone through 4 funding rounds. DapperLabs have raised a total of $52.5M but plan to raise further investment with many press sources alleging they plan to raise $250M which would give the company a $2bn valuation. 



## Business Activities:

# What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

DapperLabs is focused on Cryptocurrency and Blockchain education. Their goal is to bring this technology to the mass markets. They do this through by building trending products which have Blockchain technologies at its foundation in order to attract a wider audience who learn more about Blockchain in the process of using these products. 

# Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

DapperLab has a very wide target market. Their intention is for the average joe to have exposure to and education on Blockchain and its many possibilities as an emerging technology. 

# What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

With their development of fun, trending games, DapperLabs demonstrates that they have a very good understanding of consumer needs and how to model their products to meet them. They are very focused on communicating the positive potential of Blockchain technologies to the "man on the street". This focus and understanding provides DapperLabs with a compelling offering as a Blockchain company. Due to their success of doing so, they've managed to attract powerful partners such as the NBA. 

# Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

DapperLabs uses more than 60 technologies in their various platforms; Cryptokittens and Top Shot. For Blockchain in particular, their platforms are hosted on the Blockchain network itself ensuring that their platforms are open source and decentralised. Additionally, they use Smart contracts and crypto currency. For example, in Cryptokittens, players trade kittens with other players by exchanging crypto currency, transactions that are enforced through Smart contracts. 



## Landscape:

# What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

DapperLabs is known as a Blockchain company. 

# What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

In 2008, a man named Satashi Nakamoto conceived Blockchain. He released his first whitepaper about this technology in 2009. And ever since then, people have finding new purposes for Blockchain from everything from Bitcoin (being Blockchain's first cryptocurrency) to the NEO project. 

In 2010, the first Bitcoin purchase took place which was for an amount of 10,000 BTC. 

In 2013, Ethereum was created to be a Blockchain platform which had a multitude of different functionalities, the first of its kind as it demonstrated Blockchains potential to be usefor for more than just payments. 
In 2015, one of these functionalities of Ethereum was Smart contracts. 
However, in 2014 the NEO platform also emerged which became somewhat of a competitor to Ethereum. The advantage of NEO was that programmers could create appliations of Blockchain in traditional programming languages like Java, C# and Python. On the other hand, Ethereum could only be used using it's own programming language, Solidity. 

The other innovation to take place in 2015 was the creation of Hyperledger which was created by Linux to enhance the functionalities of Blockchain. 

Then in 2017, EOS.IO came about which was designed to create decentralised apps.

## Results

# What has been the business impact of this company so far?

DapperLabs is one of the most successful Blockchain companies of its kind. Of the many positive impacts of this company's platforms, the below is an its most powerful impacts:
1) Building an open-source, end-to-end platform aimed at onboarding 1 billion users to what is known as the "decentralised web". 


# What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

The success of Blockchain companies can be measured by several metrics, some unique to the Blockchain industry:
1) Active Users (Daily, Weekly or Monthly)
2) Total transactions (number)
3) Value of transactions (value)
4) Balances in smart contracts (value)
5) Transactions to/from contracts (number)
6) Value of transactions to/from contracts (value)
7) Blockchain rewards to users (value)
8) Wallets value (value)
9) Unique addresses
10) Active addresses
11) Wallets
12) Nodes
13) Transactions per second
14) Blocks per hour
15) Developers
16) API calls
17) Software downloads
18) Repositories
19) Commits
20) App downloads
21) Clients



# How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

The performance of DapperLab can be measured fairly well based on the success of its first platform, Crptopkittens. They have had more than 1mn kittens created on their platform. They also have the most used Smart contracts in the industry. They've had 3.6 million transactions take place on their platform. Tens of millions of dollars have been exhanged on their marketplace. 


## Recommendations

# If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

I would suggest that they create a banking app to allow for easy transfers between Domestic and International bank accounts to allow for easy transfers to friends for example. The speed and inefficiency of bank transfers is a huge problem for the population as a whole, particularly International transfers. 

By solving a huge problem for people, I believe people will learn quickly on a large scale the benefits of Blockchain. 


# Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

This banking service aligns perfectly with the purpose of the company; to bring the benefits of Blockchain to the wider population. By designing a service that people NEED and not WANT, DapperLabs would be solving a pain for people which is more compelling than something that is fun for them to do. Plus with people asking the transfer to take place on their app, this is a strong form of marketing for the company which comes at zero cost to them. 

# What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

This banking app would utilise Blockchain, Etherum, Smart Contracts and other financial technologies. 



# Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

Blockchain, particularly, Etherum is appropriate for the solution because the decentralisation of bank transfers makes for faster and more efficient money transfers.
